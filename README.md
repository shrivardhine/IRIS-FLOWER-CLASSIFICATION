 Iris Flowers Classification
 we will be dealing with Logistic Regression and Support vector Machine  Algorithm. First, we will see logistic Regression, and then we will see Support vector machine understand the working of an algorithm with the Iris flowers dataset. We all know about Iris Dataset, and it contains features of different flower species. Independent features in this dataset are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. All these lengths were in centimeters. And Dependent feature, which will be the output for the model, is Species. It contains the name of the species to which that particular flower with those measurements belongs.![image](https://github.com/shrivardhine/IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION/assets/92728340/1161a182-8344-45b4-b34e-2479ccb25d55)
